<h5>Answer:C</h5>

<h3> 6 Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False? </h3>

- A True
- B False

<h3> 7 A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False? </h3>

- A True
- B False

<h3> 9 In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent? </h3>

![introduction_to_deep_learning_09](https://github.com/cxmhfut/DeepLearning.ai/blob/master/images/introduction_to_deep_learning_09.png)

- A 
>* x-axis is the performance of the algorithm
>* y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.
- B
>* x-axis is the input to the algorithm
>* y-axis is outputs.
- C
>* x-axis is the amount of data
>* y-axis is the size of the model you train.
- D
>* x-axis is the amount of data
>* y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.
